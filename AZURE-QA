 Q19 : Azure Rapid Fire questions - Master the Basics

1. How do you resize an Azure VM?
Go to VM > Availability + scale > Size, choose a compatible VM size, and click Resize.

2. Does resizing an Azure Virtual Machine require a reboot?
Yes. Resizing normally restarts the VM. If the new size isn’t available on the current hardware cluster, Azure must stop/deallocate the VM before resizing.

3. Can we attach a Network Security Group (NSG) directly to a Virtual Network?
No. NSGs can only be attached to subnets or network interfaces (NICs).

4. Can VMs in different subnets of the same VNet communicate with each other?
Yes. Intra-VNet communication is allowed by default unless blocked by NSGs or custom routes.

5. Can an OS disk be removed from an Azure VM?
No. You cannot remove an OS disk from a running VM, but Azure supports OS disk swapping when the VM is stopped.

6. For Azure VM Backup, can the Recovery Services Vault and VM be in different regions?
No. The Recovery Services Vault and the VM must be in the same region for backup.

7. Can tags be inherited automatically by child resources in Azure?
No. Tag inheritance does not happen automatically. Azure Policy or automation is required.

8. Can a resource belong to multiple resource groups?
No. A resource can belong to only one resource group at a time.

9.Why does a Resource Group need a location in Azure?
A Resource Group needs a location because its metadata (like tags, locks, resource info, deployment history) and management information are stored in that specific region, even though its resources can exist anywhere.

10.Does Azure charge you for a stopped (but not deallocated) VM?
Yes. Azure still charges for compute when the VM is Stopped, but not Stopped (Deallocated).
