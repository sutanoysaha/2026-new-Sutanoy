1. How would you architect a secure, auditable CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps for multi-environment (Dev/Test/Prod) deployments?

2. Differentiate between classic pipelines and YAML pipelines in Azure DevOps. Which one is better for Infrastructure-as-Code and why?

3. What rollback strategies have you implemented in mission-critical environments? Can you detail a real-world example?

4. Explain the use of Jenkins Shared Libraries or Azure DevOps Templates for enterprise-level DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) pipelines.

5. How do you handle multi-repo CI/CD pipelines when deploying a microservices-based application with interdependencies?

6. Describe techniques to cache Docker layers or NuGet/NPM packages in pipelines for speed optimization.

7. How do you integrate Azure Key Vault with DevOps pipelines securely, especially with rotating secrets or certificates?

8. What is the purpose of manual intervention gates, and how would you enforce them before production release?

9. Explain how you implement compliance as code (security scanning, code coverage, policy checks) in Azure 
DevOps pipelines.

10. How do you enforce pipeline security – from source control (Git) to deployment? Tools? Policies?

11. What strategies do you use for managing Terraform state in a team? How do you handle state locking and backups in Azure?

12. Explain the differences between terraform plan, terraform refresh, and terraform apply. When should each be used?

13. How do you modularize Terraform for large-scale projects? Give examples.

14. How do you detect and resolve drift in Terraform-managed resources?

15. Explain how to set up remote Terraform backends in Azure (Blob Storage) and enable state locking with Azure CosmosDB or similar.

16. Show a use-case for for_each vs count in a real Terraform deployment. When should dynamic blocks be preferred?

17. Explain the purpose and real-world use of lifecycle blocks (prevent_destroy, create_before_destroy) in Terraform.

18. Write a Dockerfile for a secure Python/Node.js API with multistage builds and best practices.

19. How do multistage Docker builds improve security and reduce image size?

20. Differentiate between Docker volumes and bind mounts. When do you use each in a Kubernetes environment?

21. How do you implement blue-green or canary deployments in AKS using Helm or service mesh (e.g., Istio)?

22. What are liveness and readiness probes? Give a practical example of how incorrect config can lead to downtime.

23. How do you securely manage secrets and certificates in AKS using Azure Key Vault and CSI drivers?
