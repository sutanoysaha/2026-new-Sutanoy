Linux Boot Process (Step-by-Step):
a. BIOS/UEFI initializes hardware and loads the bootloader.
b. Bootloader (GRUB) loads the kernel into memory.
c. Kernel initializes hardware drivers and mounts the root filesystem.
d. init/systemd process starts and manages system services.
e. Runlevel/systemd target is reached and system becomes usable.
2. Troubleshooting a Slow Server:
a. Check CPU usage (top, htop).
b. Check memory usage (free -h, vmstat).
c. Check I/O wait (iostat, sar).
d. Check disk usage (df -h, du).
e. Check network usage (iftop, ss, netstat).
3. Check High CPU/Memory Process:
- top, htop, ps aux --sort=-%cpu, ps aux --sort=-%mem
4. Troubleshoot High I/O Wait:
- iostat -x, pidstat -d, lsof, iotop, check slow disks, heavy read/write processes.
5. Load Average vs CPU Utilization:
- Load Average: Number of processes waiting or running.
- CPU Utilization: Percentage of CPU used.
6. Check Open Ports / Listening Process:
- ss -tulpn, netstat -tulpn, lsof -i :
7. Analyze Logs for System Crash / Kernel Panic:
- /var/log/messages, /var/log/kern.log, journalctl -xe, crash dumps (/var/crash)
8. Run Levels / systemd Targets:
- multi-user.target, graphical.target, rescue.target
9. Manage Services (systemd):
- systemctl start/stop/status/enable/disable/mask
10. Check Disk Usage & Inodes:
- df -h, du -sh *, df -i
11. Causes of Boot Failure:
- GRUB issues, corrupted filesystem, kernel panic, missing disk UUID
12. Extend LVM Without Downtime:
- pvcreate, vgextend, lvextend, resize2fs/xfs_growfs
13. Schedule Cron Job & Verify:
- crontab -e, check /var/log/cron or journalctl -u crond
14. Check Deleted File Process:
- lsof | grep deleted
15. Check Swap Usage:
- free -h, swapon -s, vmstat, top





was a great reminder that real-world troubleshooting skills are just as important as theoretical knowledge.
